# Features Overview

Start with the MVP, then iterate. See:
- MVP: `./mvp.md`
- Roadmap (post-MVP): `./roadmap.md`
- Paid features: `./paid.md`
- Infra: `./infra.md`
- Modes (host/client): `./modes.md`

## Core Concepts
- Workspaces: Created by an owner; require at least one active host.
- Host & Proxy: A host exposes a secure proxy URL for clients.
- Files & Folders: Upload/download, organize, and manage content.
- Roles: Owner and members in MVP; admins and fine-grained ACLs later.

## Sponsors (where they fit)
- TanStack Start: Web app framework for UI and routes.
- Netlify: Hosts the web-only client.
- Convex (self-hosted): Realtime sync and file storage.
- Cloudflare: Secure proxy access to host machines.
- Autumn: Entitlements for paid features.

For complete MVP scope, acceptance criteria, and non-goals, see `./mvp.md`.
