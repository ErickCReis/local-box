im making a project for a hackthon, the idea is a local google drive that users can share files between teams. we will create some docs for the project features and structure

# Infra
- it will be a web application for the ui/dashboard
- it will have a bun server that interacts with the host for setup
- it will use convex self hosted https://raw.githubusercontent.com/get-convex/convex-backend/refs/heads/main/self-hosted/README.md for the data sync and file storage
- it should have a way to make a proxy that wil give access to a host machine

# Modes (host, client)
- the user can switch beetwen the modes, if switching to the host mode, it will require a setup
- in the host mode the user will need to run the server and the convex backend
- in the client mode the user only need the web aplication that can be hosted in some place, the user will login in a host though the proxy url the the host will generate
- as a host a can connect to another host making possible to select some redundancy configuration, opting for what folders/files the will be synced
- when there is multiple host it should be clear what files are in each host, and with one are replicated in multiple hosts

# Features/System
- a user can create and invite users for a workspace
- when creating a workspace the current machine will be the host, an the user will be an owner
- a workspace needs to have a least 1 host system active to works
- when create a host, the setup should guide the owner in all that steps, mainly the convex backend configuration and the proxy system
- a user can access a workspace by a proxy url generated by a host machine in that workspace
- a user can join the workspace with your machine as a host
- the owner is an admin and can give the admin role for other users
- a admin user can upload files and create folder
- a admin can manage the access for this folders/files with other user in that workspace


Create a initial document with the project description and all the information above, create a single and consive readme, and than other files for the the topics above, make sure to be concise, the main task is to organize the idea first
